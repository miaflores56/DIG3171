<p>Click above to check out my research project What You Remember! What You Remember is a Twine digital narrative about the effects of enotion and stress on memory in crucial moments, following the story of someone who gets robbed on a walk, and desperately tries to determine what happened. </p>


# Abstract

<p>Imagine you are on a walk with a friend. It is a nice day, other people are on this walk,
there is a band on the side playing songs for money, and you and your friend are chatting about
work. While on this walk, a masked robber approaches you, threatens you and makes off with
your wallet. Do you think you would remember what song the band was playing? The color of
the shirt the jogger that passed was wearing? My digital Research project explores how things
like emotion and perception impact memory. Using the digital tool Twine, my digital narrative
guides users through a simulation of an event, showing how intense emotions can affect one’s
memory. “Emotional responses such as fear, depression, and stress have impaired effects on
cognitive functions such as learning and memory…”(Jaivarsini 1) If you think back to my
example, it would be difficult for someone to remember smaller details when faced with a direct
threat. Memories created in situations of fear or stress often lead to mood-congruent memories
(Faul and Labar). It is often shown that MCM (Mood-congruent memories) can be false, or
inaccurate. This is because “Emotion determines how we perceive our world, organise our
memory, and make important decisions.” (Brosch) In some situations, one’s brain is put under
pressure, causing functions like memory to be halted or slowed due to the stress. This is an effect
of negative emotions heavily reducing memory performance (Guo). With this project, I wish to
truly show how emotion can either enhance or impair long term memory retention ( To conclude,
the digital narrative I will be making with the digital tool Twine, will guide users through an
event and demonstrate how emotions affect memory</p>
